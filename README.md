# Etchify

## Description

Etchify is single page website that creates etchings of user uploaded photos. This is achieved through line recongition and shading that matches the percieved luminosity of the original image. Users are able to customize the produced etching through a variety of settings, though the decision making process is streamlined, so that the user need only make essential choices and can optionally explore more advanced settings.

Users are able to select from four styles: shade, outline, shade & outline, and silhouette.

**Outline** employs line recongition to trace the
